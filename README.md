# GTA 6 Web Experience🌴

## Project Overview📌
<<<<<<< HEAD
GTA 6 is the most anticipated open-world title, so I developed a stunning, responsive web application dedicated to the game. Developed with modern web technologies, it focuses on delivering a high-performance and immersive interface for the GTA community. 🎮🔥

## Personal Inspiration🌟
Having played the GTA franchise since my childhood, I am a massive fan of the series. Creating this application was a passion project inspired by the years spent exploring Liberty City, San Andreas, and Los Santos.
It is designed to reflect the high quality and cinematic detail that Rockstar Games is known for—serving as a tribute to the franchise that defined my gaming journey. 🏎️💨
